- Node.js: Earler people used to type JavaScript in the browser. However, just as we have compilers for C++ and interpretors for Python. Someone ripped the functionality of JavaScript from the browser and created a runtime environment for it called Node.js. It converts the JavaScript code into machine code that can be executed by the computer. - There are other JavaScript runtime environments as well, such as Deno and Bun, which offer different features and performance characteristics compared to Node.js.
- After this happened JavaScript became a language that could be used to make:
  - Frontend web applications - React, Vue, Angular, etc.
  - Backend web applications - Node.js, Express, etc.
  - Mobile applications - React Native, Flutter, etc.
  - Desktop applications - Electron, etc.
- That is the reason why JavaScript is called the most popular language in the world.

- functions inside the classes are called methods and do not require the function keyword.
