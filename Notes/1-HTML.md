# HTML - Hypertext Markup Language

## Basic Structure

- Has 2 components: Head and Body
  - Head: Contains information about the document, such as the title, meta-data, and links to external resources ie the invisible part of the document.
  - Body: Contains the content of the document, such as text, images, and links ie the visible part of the document.

## Common terminologies

- Element: A single HTML tag and its content.

- Tags:

  - Start tag: `<tag>` This is the opening tag of an HTML element, signifying the beginning of an element.
  - End tag: `</tag>` This is the closing tag of an HTML element, marking the end of an element.
  - Example: `<h1>This is a Heading</h1>`, `<p>This is a paragraph</p>`, `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">`

- Attributes and Values:

  - Attribute: `attribute="value"` This is a property of an HTML element that provides additional information about the element, modifying its behavior or providing metadata.
  - Value: `value` This is the value assigned to a specific attribute, defining the property's specific setting.
  - Example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">`

- Container: An element that can contain other elements, example: `div` which is just a wrapper for other elements, does not do anything but contain other elements. Some more examples of containers are `section`, `article`, `header`, `footer`, `main`, `aside`, `nav`, `div`.

## Block and Inline elements

- Block elements: Elements that take up the full width of the container and create a new line.
- Inline elements: Elements that take up only as much width as necessary and do not create a new line. As the name suggests, they are within the line.
