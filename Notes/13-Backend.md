## Node.js

- Servers communicate with frontend via API.
- Earlier we saw how to make API calls from frontend, now we will see how we can make servers that handle requests and provide responses.
- We cannot just use vanilla JS to make servers, because the JS was made for frontend and hence does not have the fucntionality such as interacting with network, file system etc. Hence we use Node.js to make servers.

### Node.js

- The coder just writes JavaScript code and runs it.
- Node.js is a runtime environment that allows us to run JS code outside of the browser.

- Just like there are libraries in python example pytorch, there are modules in Node.js for example express that give additional functionality.
