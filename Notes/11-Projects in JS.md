## I realised that

- Building HTML and CSS is so easy that it is taken for granted.
- Main time was spent on JavaScript.

## How the JavaScript was being structured

- Always start with when the page loads.document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
- Get the elements from the HTML.
- Initialize the variables.
- Add event listeners and their respective functions. Use helper functions here.
- Make the helper functions.
  });
