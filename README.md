## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the projects in this repository, you'll need:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)
- MongoDB (for database projects)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-dev-masterclass.git
   cd web-dev-masterclass
   ```

2. For projects requiring Node.js, install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd [project-folder]
   npm install
   ```

3. For database projects, ensure MongoDB is running locally or configure connection to your MongoDB instance.

### Usage

Each project folder contains its own README with specific instructions for running that project. Generally:

- For front-end only projects, open the HTML file in your browser
- For Node.js projects, run:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- For React projects:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

### Reinstalling Dependencies

This repository does not include `node_modules` directories to keep it lightweight. To reinstall dependencies for any project:

1. Navigate to the project directory containing a package.json file:

   ```bash
   cd [project-folder]
   ```

2. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. For specific projects, you may need to install additional dependencies:

   - For React projects:

     ```bash
     # For Vite-based React projects
     cd "10 React/vite-project"
     npm install

     # For Next.js projects
     cd "10 React/nextjs"
     npm install

     # For Create React App projects
     cd "10 React/01basicreact"
     npm install
     ```

   - For Tailwind CSS projects:

     ```bash
     cd "3 Tailwind CSS/tailwind-practice"
     npm install
     ```

   - For Backend projects:

     ```bash
     cd "9 Project/101"
     npm install

     cd "9 Project/96"
     npm install
     ```

4. After installing dependencies, you can run the project as described in the Usage section.
